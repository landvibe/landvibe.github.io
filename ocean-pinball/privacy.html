    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Jaeseung Lee</strong> ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and
      shares information when you use <strong>Ocean Pinball</strong> (the "App").
    </p>
    <p class="meta">
      The App does <strong>not</strong> provide account registration or login features.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>1) Information We Collect</h2>

  <h3>A. Information collected automatically</h3>
  <p>The App may automatically collect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Device information</strong> (e.g., device model, OS version, language, region)</li>
    <li><strong>Identifiers</strong> (e.g., Advertising ID / AAID, app instance identifiers)</li>
    <li><strong>Usage data</strong> (e.g., in-app events such as button clicks, session duration, feature usage)</li>
    <li><strong>Diagnostics</strong> (e.g., crash reports, stack traces, performance signals)</li>
    <li><strong>Network information</strong> (e.g., IP address; approximate location derived from IP)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>B. Information you provide (limited)</h3>
  <p>
    The App does not require you to create an account. If you contact us by email, we will receive the information you
    choose to share (such as your email address and message content).
  </p>

  <h3>C. In-app purchases</h3>
  <p>
    The App uses <strong>Google Play Billing</strong> for in-app purchases. Payment information (such as credit card
    details) is processed by Google and is not collected or stored by us.
  </p>

  <h2>2) How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and maintain the App</li>
    <li>Improve features and gameplay experience (e.g., analyzing aggregated event counts)</li>
    <li>Fix bugs and improve stability (e.g., crash diagnostics)</li>
    <li>Serve ads and measure ad performance</li>
    <li>Prevent fraud and abuse</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Advertising</h2>
  <p>
    The App displays ads using <strong>Google AdMob</strong>. AdMob may collect and process identifiers (including
    Advertising ID), device information, and usage data to provide personalized or non-personalized ads and for
    measurement.
  </p>
  <p>
    Google Privacy Policy:
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a><br />
    Google Ad Technology:
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a>
  </p>

  <h2>4) Firebase / Google Services We Use</h2>
  <p>
    The App uses <strong>Firebase</strong> services (provided by Google) to operate and improve the App. These services
    may collect and process device identifiers, app instance identifiers, usage data, and diagnostics data.
  </p>

  <h3>A. Firebase Analytics</h3>
  <p>
    We use <strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> to understand how users interact with the App (for example, counting
    button click events and other in-app events). We use this information to improve gameplay and features.
  </p>

  <h3>B. Firebase Crashlytics</h3>
  <p>
    We use <strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong> to diagnose crashes and stability issues. Crash reports may include
    device state, crash stack traces, and app performance/diagnostic information.
  </p>

  <h3>C. Firebase Remote Config</h3>
  <p>
    We use <strong>Firebase Remote Config</strong> to deliver configuration values (e.g., event settings, balancing
    parameters, feature flags) to your app instance. Remote Config may use app instance identifiers to deliver and
    evaluate configurations.
  </p>

  <h3>D. Cloud Firestore</h3>
  <p>
    We use <strong>Cloud Firestore</strong> to store and retrieve app data required for features and live content.
    Because the App has no login, Firestore data (if any) is typically associated with an <strong>app instance</strong>
    rather than a named account.
  </p>
  <div class="box">
    <p><strong>What we may store in Firestore (examples):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Game configuration / content data (e.g., level/event data)</li>
      <li>Aggregated counters or anonymous gameplay metrics (e.g., totals, balances)</li>
      <li>Device/app instance scoped state needed for gameplay (if applicable)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="meta">
      We do not intentionally store sensitive personal information (such as real names, precise addresses, or payment
      card information) in Firestore.
    </p>
  </div>

  </p>

  <h2>5) Sharing of Information</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell your personal information. We may share information:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>With <strong>service providers</strong> (e.g., Google/Firebase/AdMob) to operate analytics, ads, and diagnostics</li>
    <li>To comply with <strong>legal obligations</strong> or respond to lawful requests</li>
    <li>To protect the rights, safety, and security of users, the public, and our services</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6) Legal Bases (EEA/UK users)</h2>
  <p>
    If you are located in the EEA/UK, we process personal data based on:
    <strong>consent</strong> (e.g., personalized advertising where required) and/or <strong>legitimate interests</strong>
    (e.g., basic analytics, app security, and crash diagnostics), as permitted by applicable law.
  </p>

  <h2>7) Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Advertising ID / Ad personalization</strong>: You can reset or limit ad personalization via your Android
      settings (Settings → Privacy → Ads), and/or via your Google account ad settings.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Purchases</strong>: You can manage subscriptions and purchases in your Google Play account.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8) Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We do not maintain our own user account database. Data processed by Google/Firebase/AdMob is retained according to
    their policies and settings. We retain support emails only as long as needed to respond and for record-keeping.
  </p>

  <h2>9) Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the minimum age required in your country). If you
    believe a child has provided personal information, please contact us and we will take appropriate steps.
